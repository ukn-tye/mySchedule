# mySchedule
Module 5 Work day schedule project 
I had a lot of trouble with assigment I pretty sure i'm going to need some tutoring on this topic, but It was still very helpful to be challenged and made to think so hard and create soemthing like this. I am more of a designer so javascript is a struggle for me but i will take this assignment and **grade** as an example to practice and use it a while lot more.
